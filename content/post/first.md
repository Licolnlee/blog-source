## Install Hugo
### Quick Install
#### Binary(Cross-platform)
Download the appropriate version for your platform from [Hugo Releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. You don’t need to install it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin`is the most probable location.
